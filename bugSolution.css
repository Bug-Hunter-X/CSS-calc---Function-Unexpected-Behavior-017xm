To fix the `calc()` issue, ensure both operands have consistent units. You can convert the pixel value to a percentage or vice versa.  Here are two possible solutions:

**Solution 1 (Converting pixels to percentage):**

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% + 20%);
}
```

This solution assumes that `100px` is approximately 20% of the parent container's width.

**Solution 2 (Converting percentage to pixels):**

This approach requires knowing the parent's width, which might not always be possible.  If you know the parent's width (let's assume it's 500px), you could do this:

```css
div {
  width: calc(250px + 100px);
}
```
This solution converts 50% (of 500px) to 250px.
